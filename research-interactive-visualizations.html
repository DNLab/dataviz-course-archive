<h1>Assignment: Research Interactive Visualizations</h1>
<p>Search the Web for an interactive data visualization with multiple linked views.</p>
<p>The visualization must <em>not </em>be on bl.ocks.org, and it should <em>not</em> be a toy example demonstrating a certain programming technique, library or framework. It should be a real-world product, that is intended to communicate information to a certain audience. For example, <a href="https://twitter.com/nytgraphics">pieces done by the New York Times</a>, or by <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/">Five Thirty Eight</a> would be acceptable.</p>
<p>The visualization must also <em>not</em> be one that another student submitted already.</p>
<p>The visualization must have one of the following interaction patterns (from Chapter 12):</p>
<ul>
<li>Linked Highlighting</li>
<li>Linked Navigation</li>
<li>Overview-detail</li>
