<p><strong>Please Read</strong><span>: Chapter 5 &ldquo;Marks and Channels&rdquo;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>This, to me, is&nbsp;<em>the most interesting and meaningful</em> topic in data visualization. Please do a detailed reading of this particular chapter.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Please Read/Skim:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.parc.com/istl/groups/uir/publications/items/UIR-1986-02-Mackinlay-TOG-Automating.pdf">Automating the Design of Graphical Presentations of Relational&nbsp;Information by Jock Mackinlay (PDF)</a></p>
<ul>
<li>This seminal paper from 1986 shows a slightly different angle on the Marks and Channels concept, particularly the rankings. Please pay special attention to figures 14 and 15. This work eventually became <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you did get a copy of "Semiology of Graphics"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have a look through Chapter II. "The Properties of the graphic system". I recommend speed-reading this in the first pass, spending a few seconds on each page and taking in all the graphics.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Please watch:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">This lecture, which predates the book, uses hand-drawn diagrams and is more influenced by the Semiology of Graphics. I really love this one because it shows her thought process while working on the book.</li>
