<title>Assignment: Help Unblock</title>
</head>
<body>
<p><span>For this assignment, please find a discussion in the course Slack in which a fellow student is "</span><span>#blocked" and asking for help on the project, and take a bit ofÂ some time to investigate the issue and help out (or otherwise participate in the discussion to help narrow down the solution to unblock).</span></p>
<p><span>For example you could say things like:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Are there any errors in the console?</span></li>
<li><span>Can you please post a link to the code? Otherwise it's nearly impossible to help debug.</span></li>
<li><span>Did you try ... ?</span></li>
<li><span>Here's a fork of the Block that fixes the issue ...</span></li>
<li>Here's a pull request on your repository that fixes the issue ...</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Please paste your comment in Slack as the Canvas submission. Thank you!</span></p>
