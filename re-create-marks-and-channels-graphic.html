<h1>Assignment: Re-create Marks & Channels Graphic</h1>
<p>Re-create one of the small graphics from Chapter 5 using D3.js. Each student will create a <strong>different</strong> graphic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Please <strong>add your name</strong> in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iFCXPwce-BQmJEHVGNYsNq_Ub9y5JfiMAO-_-ZPan2o/edit?usp=sharing">Google Doc of Graphics</a> to claim the graphic you'll create.</li>
<li>Please start from scratch, using D3 version 4 (not version 3).
<ul>
<li>When asking for help - don't hesitate! - please ask your questions in the <a href="https://d3js.slack.com/messages/C07EVSL59/">#help channel of the global D3 Slack</a> (<a href="https://d3-slackin.herokuapp.com/">join</a>) or in our class Slack. I (Curran) will keep an eye out for your questions and do my best answer them.</li>
<li>Be sure to post work-in-progress bl.ocks links when asking for help, so others may better assist.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Publish your work on bl.ocks.org.</li>
<li>Review the grading criteria in detail, double check everything is there.</li>
<li>Submit the bl.ocks.org URL as the submission for this assignment.</li>
<li>Please share your work in the #homework-submissions channel in the course Slack group.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Cross-pollination (copy-pasting of code) between other student's work is fine, <strong>as long as you mention in the README</strong> something like "Inspired by &lt;link to bl.ock&gt;" or <span> "Draws from by &lt;link to bl.ock&gt;".</span></p>
