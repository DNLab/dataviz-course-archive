<title>Assignment: Track Project Issues</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>GitHub has an amazing issue tracking functionality built in. Please use it to track the tasks for your project.</p>
<p>Please watch this video to get more familiar with GitHub issues, pull requests, and the Git-based workflow.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jLWZaFzPS6Q" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>To complete this assignment, please create one issue in GitHub for each of the tasks you presented in your final proposal. Each task should have a short title, and should have a description that fully specifies the nature of the task, and what exactly needs to get done in order for the issue to be closed.</p>
<p>If an issue feels like it confuses multiple tasks, please split it up into multiple separate issues. </p>
<p>Please submit the issues URL for your repository as the submission for this in Canvas. For example, <a href="https://github.com/curran/dataviz-project-template/issues">https://github.com/curran/dataviz-project-template/issues</a> , but using your username and repositoruy name. You can get this URL by clicking on "issues" in your repository.</p>
<p>Please also share this link in the course Slack, so others can see and comment on your issues.</p>
<p>Hopefully this sort of issue tracking will help you manage the work that needs to get done for your project, and also give you a sense of your velocity in terms of how many issues you can close per week. Please do start working on these issues themselves as well, after you've created them.</p>
<p>By the way, you need to enable issues like this:<br><img src="%24IMS-CC-FILEBASE%24/capture.jpg?canvas_download=1&amp;canvas_qs_wrap=1" alt="capture.jpg"></p>
<p>Also, feel free to open new issues on the template project <a href="https://github.com/curran/dataviz-project-template/issues">https://github.com/curran/dataviz-project-template/issues</a> if anything about the template project itself needs improvement or clarification.</p>
<p>If you're new to GitHub, this video might also be useful:<br><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Q6HbQRWAMM4" width="560" height="314" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
