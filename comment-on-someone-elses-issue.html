<h1>Assignment: Comment on Someone Else's Issue</h1>
<p>Everyone's project tasks will be flowing into Slack as GitHub issues links.</p>
<p>Please open someone else's list of issues and look through it, then make a comment on one of the issues.</p>
<p>The nature of the comment could be something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm facing a similar issue &lt;paste link&gt;, I wonder how you will solve this.</li>
<li>I've seen this solved in a bl.ock actually, it's here &lt;paste link&gt;</li>
<li>This is such a cool idea!</li>
<li>This issues seems a bit to large, perhaps better to split it into multiple issues.</li>
<li>This issue doesn't have enough of a description to really know when it's done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please submit the link to the issue in Canvas as the submission, and also please post the issue link to Slack, including any comments that make it unique or interesting.</p>
