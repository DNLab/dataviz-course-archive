<title>Assignment: Final Project Video</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Please create a video presentation of your final project, after having completed the final finishing touches.</p>
<p>This should be no more than 8 minutes, and should capture the essence of the project.</p>
<p>As you've already written the script for this, the work consists of</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording - Mainly screen capture, but a bit of your face would be nice for the opening and closing at least</li>
<li>Editing - Please do basic editing (if required), such as removing silences and false starts</li>
</ul>
<p>This video, along with the project source code and deployed program, will be your main achievement from this course, which you can show off in your professional portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>Please upload the video to YouTube and submit the link to the video as the submission for this assignment.</strong></p>
<p>Please also link to the video from your project README (optional, but highly recommended).</p>
<p>Please also put a link from the video to the project.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>For making videos, I'd recommend the following software:
<ul>
<li>Screen capture software such as<span> </span><a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> (if you're on Mac, QuickTime works well for this).
<ul>
<li>(optional) This has an option for a webcam face overlay in the corner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(Optional) Video editing software such as<span> </span><a href="https://kdenlive.org/">KDEnlive</a>
<ul>
<li>for editing out silences and false starts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you find another tool that works for you, please share it with the class (there's so much out there).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Please include your bl.ocks.org profile page as the first scene of the video.<br>
<ul>
<li>Please add an image to your GitHub profile, it makes your bl.ocks.org profile look more professional.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
