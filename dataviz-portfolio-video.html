<title>Assignment: Dataviz Portfolio Video</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Make a video where you step through your works thus far on bl.ocks.org and describe each one. This should include all work from Weeks 1 - 3. <strong>Please try to make the video less than 10 minutes.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For making videos, I'd recommend the following software:
<ul>
<li>Screen capture software such as <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> (if you're on Mac, QuickTime works well for this).
<ul>
<li>(optional) This has an option for a webcam face overlay in the corner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(Optional) Video editing software such as <a href="https://kdenlive.org/">KDEnlive</a>
<ul>
<li>for editing out silences and false starts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you find another tool that works for you, please share it with the class (there's so much out there).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Please include your bl.ocks.org profile page as the first scene of the video.<br>
<ul>
<li>Please add an image to your GitHub profile, it makes your bl.ocks.org profile look more professional.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can click through each link, and describe each visualization for a minute or so.</li>
<li>Please discuss anything <em>interesting</em> about the visualization, data, or underlying phenomena.
<ul>
<li>Observations, insights into how things are.</li>
<li>Surprises - "I was surprised to see that..."</li>
<li>New questions - "Why is it like that?"</li>
<li>Any random information about your process of creation or finding the data - "I was always really interested in X and I found this data..."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Please post the video on YouTube.
<ul>
<li>You can make it "unlisted" if you really don't want the world to see - but I'd recommend "public" as this can be part of your professional portfolio.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Submit the YouTube link as the submission for this assignment in Canvas.</li>
<li>Please post the link to the course Slack channel, and watch everyone else's videos.</li>
</ul>
