<h1>Assignment: Deploy your Project</h1>
<p>Please deploy your project to the Web using GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>This video shows you how it can be done:<br><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vvPVZ_rq6Ek" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Also please add the link to the project somewhere prominent, either as the "Repository site" (as demonstrated in the video), or as a link in the README.</p>
<p>For submission of this, please do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submit the URL of your repository (not the GitHub Pages link -- I should be able to quickly find the link from the repository itself).</li>
<li>Take a screenshot of the browser window content and post it to Slack, along with your repository link (be careful not to include your bookmarks bar ;) ).</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking forward to seeing some awesome work in progress!</p>
