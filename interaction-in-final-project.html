<h1>Assignment: Interaction in Final Project</h1>
<p>Many students are behind on implementing the visions described in the proposals.</p>
<p>As we have only two weeks left, please focus on getting the most essential visualizations and features working in your final project, most importantly <strong>at least one interaction that you described in your project proposal.</strong></p>
<p>If you are still stuck on technical challenges, please try hard to break through the challenge with relentless debugging (use console.log() to figure out what is going on), and also please ask for help in the course Slack channel. Please prefix your question with "#blocked" if the issue is preventing your project from moving along.</p>
<p>If you already have interaction working in your project, congratulations! Please take this week and focus on making your project <em>awesome</em>, and also please do help others who are "#blocked". Thank you.</p>
<p>Please submit the URL of the final project here.</p>
