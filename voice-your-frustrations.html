<h1>Assignment: Voice your Frustrations</h1>
<p>We're getting to that point where the rubber meets the road, and "technical difficulties" are coming to the forefront of your experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The things I'm asking you to do in this course are technically challenging, and I know there will be roadblocks and frustrations along the way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please for this assignment, post in Slack about an experience that has been frustrating for you so far in this course. For example, experiences with Blockbuilder, learning ES6, learning D3, getting something working, the General Update Pattern, or to do with the project. Just vent, on any frustrating experience you've had so far with this course.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please post in Slack, and copy the text as the submission for this assignment in Canvas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Don't be shy!</p>
